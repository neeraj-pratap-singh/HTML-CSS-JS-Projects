Question 1: Count occurrences of elements in an array

Skill Mapping: Basic

Description: Write a JavaScript function that takes an array as input and counts the occurrences of each element in the array. Return an object with element counts.

Sample Input   :           [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5]

Output             :           { 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1 }

Question 2: Find the average of numbers in an array

Skill Mapping: Basic

Description - Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers as input and calculates the average value of the numbers.

Sample Input   :           [5, 10, 15, 20]

Output             :           12.5 (average of 5, 10, 15, and 20)

Question 3. Array Sorting

Description: You have an array of numbers, and you need to sort it in ascending order. Write a function that takes the array as input and returns the sorted array.

Input: An array of numbers: [7, 2, 9, 1, 5]

Output: The sorted array: [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]

Question 4. Prime Numbers Count

Description: Write a program that takes a range of numbers as input and counts the number of prime numbers within that range.

Input: Range of numbers: 1 to 20

Output: The number of prime numbers: 8

Question 5. Problem: Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array

Description: Write a JavaScript function that takes two sorted arrays as input and merges them into a single sorted array. The resulting array should contain all the elements from both input arrays in ascending order.

Example:

Input: [1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Question 6: Factorial Calculation

Description: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer.

Input: 6

Output: The factorial of 6 is 720.

Question 7: Array Element Sum

Description: You are given an array of numbers. Write a program that calculates the sum of all the elements in the array.

Input: An array of numbers: [4, 9, 2, 5, 1]

Output: The sum of the elements is 21.

Question 8: Object Key Search

Description: You have an object representing a contact list. Write a function that takes a name as input and searches the contact list for the corresponding phone number. If the name is found, return the phone number; otherwise, return a message indicating that the contact does not exist.

Input: Contact list object: { "John Doe": "123-456-7890", "Emma Smith": "987-654-3210" }, Name: "Emma Smith"

Output: The phone number for Emma Smith is 987-654-3210.

Question 9: Array Reversal

Description: Write a function that reverses the elements of an array, without using the built-in reverse() method.

Input: An array of strings: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Output: The reversed array: ["cherry", "banana", "apple"]

Question 10: Object Property Update

Description: You have an object representing a student record. Write a function that takes the student object and a new grade as input and updates the grade property with the new value.

Input: Student object: { name: "John", grade: 85 }, New grade: 90

Output: The updated student object: { name: "John", grade: 90 }
